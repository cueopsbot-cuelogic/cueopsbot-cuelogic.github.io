/* Below is the sample jenkins file which mainly consists of 5 block sthe mian parent block is the "PIPELINE" block ,
   pipeline block has netsted block  eg , "environment" , "stages" and "post" , stages block has netsted block which is "steps"
   block. stages will be executed sequentially in an order they are mentioned.
   ====================================================================================================================
   NOTE:- this is the sample jenkins file which mentions signiicance and use of each stage, There is no need to add all the stages 
          in single jenkins file this is just for reference.
          please read carefully the commented lines before including any stages into your jenkins file.
          we will also include a sample jenkins file in our docs which you can  use in your project, as most of the stages 
          in that sample jenkins file will be used by your project.
          this file is just for explainantion purpose.
